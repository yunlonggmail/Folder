# Table Of Contents(the real thing)

## 1.Your First App: Meet Android 

<h4>So you're think:"What makes Android so special?"</h4>
Android is a **free and open operation system ** form **Google** that runs on all kinds of devices from **phones**,to **tablets** and even **televisions**. That's a ton of devices you can target with just one platform!(And the market share is ganing too!) Google provides all of the stuff you need to get started building Android apps **for free**. You can build your Android apps on Macs, Windows, or Unix and publish you apps for next to nothing(with no need for anyone's approval). Ready to get started? Great! You're going to start building your first Android app, but first there are a few things to set up... 

## 2.Give your app an action:Adding behavior
**Apps are interactive!** When it comes to apps, it's what your **users can do** with your apps that make them love'em. As you saw in Chapter 1, Android really separates out the **visual definition** of your apps(remember all that XML layout and String resources that work you just did!) **from the behavior** that's defined in Java code. In this Chapter,you're going to **add some behavior** to the AndroidLove haiku app. And in the process you'll learn how the XML resources and Java work seamlessly together to give you a great way to build your Android apps!

## 3.Pictures from space: Work with feeds
**RSS feeds are everywhere!** From weather and stock information to news and blogs, huge amounts of content are distributed in RSS feeds and just waitng to be used in your apps. In fact, the RSS feed publishers want you to use them! In this chapter, you'll learn how to build your own app that incorporates **content** from a public RSS feed on the web. Along the way, you'll also learn a little more about **layouts, permissions,and debugging.**

## 4.When things take: Long-running processes
**It would be great if everything hanppened instantly.** Unfortunately, some things just take time. This is especially true on mobile devices, where net work latency and the occasionally slow processors in phones can cause things to take a bit longer. You can make your apps faster with optimizations, but some things just take time. But you can learn how to manage long-running processes better. In this chapter, you'll learn how to show active and passive status to your users. You'll also learn how to perform expensive operations off the UI thread to guarantee your app is always responsive.

## 5. Run your app everywhere:multiple-device support

**There are a log of different sized Android devices out there.** You've got big screens, little screens, and everything in between. And it's your job to support them all! Sounds crazy,right? You're probably thinking right now "**How can I possibly support all of these different devices?**" But with the right strategies, you'll be able to target all of these devices **in no time** and with **confidence.** In this chapter, you'll learn how Android classifies all of these different devices into groups based on **screen size** as well as screen density. Using these grous, you'll able to make your app look great on all of these different devices, and all with a **manageable** amount of work!

## 6.Tablets are not just big phones:Optimizing for tablets
**Android tablets are comming onto the scene.** These new larger-fomat Android devices give you an entirely new hardware format to present new and cool apps to your users. **But they are not just big phones!** In this chapter, you'll learn how to get your app up and running on a tablet. You'll learn about the new screen size groupings and also how to use Fragments to combine multiple Activities on a single screen. So more importantly then just running on tablets in this chapter, you'll learn about how to **make your app work better** on them;

## 7.Building a list-based app:Lists and adpaters
**Where would we be without lists?** They display read-only information, provide a way for users to select form large data sets, or even act as natigational device by building up an app with a list-based menu structure. In this chapter, you'll learn how to build an app with a list. You learn about where lists store data(in Adapters) and how to customize how that data is rendered in your list. You'll also learn about adding additional layouts to you app(not just the layout that the Wizard creates f ro you) and turn that into a real view

## 8.Navigation:Multi-screen apps
**Eventually you'll need to build apps with more than one screen.** So far, all of the apps you've built only have a single screen. But the great apps you're going to build may need more than that! In this chapter,you'll learn how to do just that. You'll build an app with a couple of screens, and you'll learn how to create a new Activity and layout which was previously done for you by the Wizard. You'll learn how to navigate between screens and even pass data between them. You'll also learn how to make your own Android context men-the menu that pops up when press the Menu button!

## 9.Store your stuff with SQLite: Database persitence
**In memory data storage only gets you so far.** In the last chapter,you build a list adapter that only stored data in memory. But if you want the app to **remember** data between sessions, you need **persist** the data. There are a few ways to persist data in Android including writing directly to files and using the built in SQLite database. In this chapter, you'll learn to use the more robust SQLite database solution. You learn how to create and manage your own SQLite database. You'll also learn how to integrate that SQLite database with the ListView in the TimeTracker app. And don't worry, if you're new to SQL, you'll learn enough to get started and pointers to more information.

## 10.It's all relative: Relativelayout
**You've created a few screens now using LinearLayouts(and even nested LinearLayouts).** But that will only get you so far. Some of the screens you'll need to build in your own apps will need to do things that you just can't do with LinearLayout. But don't worry! Android comes with other layouts that you can use. IN this chapter, you'll learn about another super powerful layout called RelativeLayout. This allows you to layout Views on screen relative to each other(hence the name). It's new way to layout your Views, and as you'll see in the chapter, a way to optimize your screen layouts.

## 11. Giving your app some polish: Tweaking your ui
**With all the competition in the marketplace, your apps must do more than just work.** They have to look great doing it! Sometimes, basic graphics and layouts will work. But other times, you'll need to crank it up to a notch. In this chapter, you'll learn about a new layout manager called Relative Layout. It'll let you lay out your screens in ways that you just can't do with LinearLayout and help you code your designs just the way you want them. You'll also learn more techniques for using images to polish up the look and feel of your app. Get your app noticed!

## 12. Make the best of what you can use:Content providers. 
**You don't want to reinvent the wheel, do you?** Of course you don't; you've got apps to build! Well, one of the awesome benefits of Android is the ease in which you can use bits of other applications with content providers. Android apps can expose functionality they want to share and you can use that in our apps. But this doesn't work only for market apps; a number of build-in apps(like the Address Book)expose stuff you can use in your apps too. In this chapter, you'll learn how to use content providers in your app. And who knows, you might like this whole content provider thing so much, you'll decide to provide some of your own content to other apps!
