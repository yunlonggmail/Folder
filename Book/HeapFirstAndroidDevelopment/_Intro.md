# Intro
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how to use this book?

## Who is this book for?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can answer "yes" to all of these:

1. Have you done some Java programming, but don't consider yourself a master?
2. Do you want to build mobile apps for an awesome mobile OS that runs tons of devices?
3. Do you prefer stimulating dinner party conversation to dry, dull, academic lectures?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this book is for you.

## Who should probably back away from this book?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can answer "yes" to any of these:

1. Have you already mastered Android programming but need a solid reference?
2. Are you solid with the basic Android development fundamentals and just looking for a guide to its super-advanced features, like ADL or services?
3. Are you afraid to try something different? Would you rather have a root canal than mix stripes with plaid? Do you believe that a technical book can't be serious if it anthropomorphizes control groups and objective functions?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this book is not for you.

## We know what you're thinking

"How can this be a serious Android development book?"<br/>
"What's with all the graphics?"<br/>
"Can I actually learn it this way?"

## We know what your brain is thinking
Your brain craves novelty. It's always searching, scanning, wating for something unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive. 

So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal things you encounter? Everything it can to stop them from interfering with the brain's real job--recording things that matter. It doesn't bother saving the boring things; they never make it past the "this is obviously not important" filter

How does your brain know what's important? Suppose you're out for a day hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens inside your head and body?

Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge.

And that's how your brain knows...

## This must be important! Don't forget it!
But imagine you're at home, or in a library. It's a safe, warm,tiger-free zone. You're studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or trying to learn some tough technical topic your boss thinks will take a week, ten days at the most.

Just one problem. Your brain's trying to do you a big favor. It's trying to make sure that this obviously non-important content doesn't clutter up scarce resources. Resources that are better spent storing the really big things. Like tigers. Like the danger of fire. Like how you should never have posted those "party" photos on your Facebook page. And there's no simple way to tell your brain, "Hey brain, thank you very much, but no matter how dull this book is ,and how little I'm registering on the emotional Richer scale right now, I really do want you to keep this stuff around."

## Metacognition: thinking about thinking
If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you learn..

Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were growing up. We were expected to learn, but rarely taught to learn.

But we assume that if you're holding this book, you really want to learn Android. And you probably don't want to spend a lot of time. If you want to use what you read in this book, you need to remember what you read. And for that, you've got to understand it. To get the most from this book, or any book or learning experience, take reponsibility for your brain. Your brain on this content.

The trick is to get your brain to see the new material your're learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a tiger. Otherwise, you're in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.

## So just how DO you get your brain to treat Android like it was a hungry tiger?

There's the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The slow way is about sheer repetition. Your obviously know that your are able to learn and remember even the dullest of topice if you keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, "This doesn't feel importmant to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing over and over and over, so I suppose it must be."

The faster way is to do **anything that increase brain activity,** espicially different types brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution and they're all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words within the pictures they describe(as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to makes sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to get that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.

A coversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they're in a coversation，since they're ecpected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn't necessarily care that the "coversation" is between your and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.

But pictures and conversational style are just the begining...

## Here's what WE did:
We used pictures, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain's concerned, a picture really is worth a thousand words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text in the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is within the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the text somewhere.

We used **redundancy**, saying the same thing in different ways and with different media type and multiple senses, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.

We used concepts and pictures in **unexpected** ways because your brain is tuned for novelty and we used pictures and ideas with at least some **emotional** content, beacause your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which causes your to feel you to feel something is more likely to be remembered, even if tha feeling is nothing more than a little **humor,suprise,or interest**

We used a personalized, **conversational style** , because your brain is tuned to pay more attention when it believes you're in a conversation than if it thinks you're passively listening to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you're reading.

We included more than 80 activities, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember more when you **do** things than when you read about things. And we made the exercises challenging-yet-do-able, because that's what most people prefer.

We used **multiple learning styles**, because you might prefer step-by-step procedures, while someone else wants to understanding the big picture first,and someone else just wants to see an example. But regardless of your own learning preference, everyone benifits from seeing the same content represented in multiple ways.

We include content for **both sides of your brain,** beacuse the more of your brain you engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of time.

And we included **stories** and exercises that persent **more than on point of view,** because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it's forced to make evaluations and judgement.

We included **challenges**, with exercises, and by asking **questions** that don't always have a straight answer,beacause your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to work at somting. Thinking about it--you can't get your body in shape just by watching people at the gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you're working hard, it's on the right things. That **you're not spending one extra dendrite** processing a hard-to-understand example, or parsing difficult, jargon-landen, or overly terse text.

We used people. In stories, example, pictures, etc., because, well, because you're a person. And your brain pays more attention to people than it does to things.

## Here's what YOU can do to bend your brain into submission

SO, We did our part. The rest is up to you. These tips are a stating point; listen to your brain and figure out what works for you and what doesn't. Try new thing.

### 1. Slow down. The more you understand, the less you have to memorize.
Don't just read. Stop and think. When the book asks you a question, don't just skip to answer. Imagine that someone really is asking the question. The more deeply you force your brain to think, the better chance you have of learning and remembering.

### 2. Do the exercises. Write your own notes.
We put them in, but if we did them for you, that would be like having someone else do your workouts for you. And don't just look at the execises. **Use a pencil.** There's plenty of evidence that physical activity while learning can increase the learning.

### 3. Read the "There are No Dumb Questions"
That means all of them. They're not optional sidebars, **they're part of the core content!** Dont't skip them.

### 4. Make this the last thing your read before bed. Or at least the last challenging thing.
Part of the learning(espically the transfer to long-term memory) happens after you put the book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more processing. If you put it in something new during that processing time, some of what you just learned will be lost.

### 5. Talk about it. Out loud.
Speaking activites a different part of the brain. if you're trying to understand something, or increase your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud.Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else. You'll learn more quickly, and you might uncover ideas you hadn't know were there when you were reading about it.

### 6. Drink water. Lots of it.
Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. Dehydration(which can hanppend before you ever feel thristy) decreases cognitive function.

### 7. Listen to your brain.
Pay attention to whether your brain is getting overloaded. If you find yourself staring to skim the surface or forget what you just read, it's time for a break. Once You go past a certain point, you won't learn faster by trying to shove more in, and you might even hurt the process.

### 8. Feel something.
Your brain needs to know that this matters. Get involved with the stories. Make up your own captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke is still better than feeling nothing at all.

### 9.Get your hands dirty!
There's only one way to learn to Android: get your hands dirty. And that's what you're going to throughout this book. Android Development is a skill, and the only way to get good at it is to practive. We're going to give you a lot of practice:
every chapter has exercises that pose a problem for you to solve. Don't just skip over them--a lot of the learning happens when you solve the exercises. We included a solution if you get stuck!(It's easy to get snagged on something small.) But try to solve the problem before you look at the solution. And definitely get it working before you move on to the next part of the book.
